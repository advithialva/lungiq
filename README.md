## Features
- **ðŸ“¸ Image-Based Disease Prediction**:   
  Upload X-ray images of the lungs to receive accurate predictions about the presence of pneumonia, COVID-19, or a normal lung condition.

- **ðŸ¤– Advanced AI Technology**:   
  Utilizes a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large datasets to classify X-ray images with high precision.

- **âš¡ Fast and Reliable Results**:   
  Get instant diagnostic results, helping in the early detection of potential lung diseases for prompt medical attention.

- **ðŸ“š Comprehensive Insights**:   
  Along with disease predictions, Luniq provides valuable insights about the diseases, including symptoms, progression, and treatment options.

## How To Use
### 1. Visit the LungIQ platform  
Capture a clear, high-quality X-ray image of the patient's lungs. Ensure the image is well-lit and sharp to enhance prediction accuracy.

### 2. Upload the X-ray Image  
Easily upload the X-ray image to Luniq's platform. The uploaded image is processed through an advanced deep learning model that detects and classifies the condition of the lungs.

### 3. Wait for the Results  
Once the image is processed, LungIQ provides the prediction result, indicating whether the X-ray shows signs of pneumonia, COVID-19, or normal lung conditions.
